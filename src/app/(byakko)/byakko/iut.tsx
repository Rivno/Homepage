        After the end of the common school cursus, I start my studies in
        computer science in the technical university of Velizy, for 2 years to
        get a License 2 level diploma. I got the opportunity there to start
        learning about algorithmic (in pseudo code), programmation (ASM x86, C,
        C++ and php) and admin sys (Windows and Linux). This period end with a 3
        months internship where I will use my first development language in a
        professional environment, COBOL.
